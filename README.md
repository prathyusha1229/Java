# Java
Open your preferred IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or Visual Studio Code).

Import the project: Import the "Project1" folder as a Maven project in your IDE. # I have created the project name as Project1

Resolve Dependencies: Your IDE should automatically download the required dependencies specified in the pom.xml file. If not, right-click on the project, go to Maven, and click "Update Project."

Build the Project: After resolving dependencies, build the project to ensure that everything compiles correctly.

Make sure you have set up the H2 Database connection in the application.properties file as mentioned earlier in the instructions.

Run the Spring Boot Application: To run the application, find the main class (which contains the main method) and right-click on it. Then, select "Run As" and choose "Java Application" to start the Spring Boot application.

Verify the Application: Once the application is running, you should see some logs indicating that the server is up and running. By default, the application should be accessible at (http://localhost:8080/h2-console)

Using Postman: You can use Postman (https://www.postman.com/) to test the REST API endpoints.

In the test package, create a new JUnit test class for the MemberController class. For example, MemberControllerTest.

Use Mockito or any other testing framework to mock the dependencies (e.g., MemberRepository) used in the MemberController.

Write test methods to cover different scenarios for the REST API endpoints.

Run the JUnit tests to ensure that the endpoints are behaving as expected and handling various input scenarios correctly.
